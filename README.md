# PrestoProgramingKit (ppkit)
This is a programming kit that offers an all-in-one solution for building modern C and C++ applications (#NoNeedRorRust). If you are searching for simple and fun to use cmd tool with integration as nvim plugin you are at the right place! Yes, there are for suuuuure more porefull tools out there, a lot more modular, but i think this could be useful cause if it's simple to use design. 

> ### Disclaimer 
> Devolping good software is like composing a symphony. To truly create beautiful music you have to know your instruments inside out. Part of a software developer's instruments are the software building tools or IDE's. The <span style="color:red;">**ppkit**</span> or <span style="color:red;">**pkit**</span> project is primarily created for me to learn how these tools work. I know it's not magic even if it looks like that, so I decided to really dive deep into it and create a tool for me that on the one hand teaches me how these tools works and on the other hand simplifies creating good C and Cpp applications and make it a joy. It's designed to be modular and flexible so it grows with me and the challenges I am facing during my devolpment carrier. I know it's not the best, maybe it's the worst, tool out there but it's **mine!** Feel free to have fun using it, too<br/>

Pkit is designed 
It's completely written in Lua to be a nvim-plugin (pkit) and also a commandline-tool (ppkit).<br/>
It could therefore also be integrated in other IDE's (CLion, vscode, Eclipse) but because it's my private project currently only nvim and linux debian is supported.

OpenSource tools:<br/> 
- Ninja: building the applications
- CMake: generating the Ninja files
- Conan: package manager
- pkit: own (nvim) core engine for managing the project
- cppcheck: detecting memory leaks, invalid pointer usage, buffer overflows, etc.
- Clang static analyzer: finding bugs
- Clang (LLVM): compiler system

## Development
This is a WIP and currently before alpha-1.0 so don't expect anything to work!

## Installation
