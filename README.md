# PrestoProgramingKit (ppkit)
This is a programming kit that offers an all-in-one solution for building modern C and C++ applications. #NoNeedRorRust <br/>
It's completely written in Lua to be a nvim-plugin (pkit) and also a commandline-tool (ppkit).<br/>
It could therefore also be integrated in other IDE's (CLion, vscode, Eclipse) but because it's my private project currently only nvim and linux debian is supported.

OpenSource tools:<br/> 
- Ninja: building the applications
- CMake: generating the Ninja files
- Conan: package manager
- pkit: own (nvim) core engine for managing the project
- cppcheck: detecting memory leaks, invalid pointer usage, buffer overflows, etc.
- Clang static analyzer: finding bugs
- Clang (LLVM): compiler system

## Development
This is a WIP and currently before alpha-1.0 so don't expect anything to work!

## Installation
